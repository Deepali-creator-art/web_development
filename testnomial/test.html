        <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

            C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
            
            C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
            
            The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.</p>
